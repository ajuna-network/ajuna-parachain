# Zombienet setup designed to test the runtime upgrade and its migration by refering to an old chain-spec.json.
#
# The upgrade can be done via polkadot-js/apps:
#   1.  Create chain-spec with the old collator-node containing our current production network with:
#       `./scripts/dump_wasm_state_and_spec.sh <desired_chain>` and copy it into this directory.
#   2.  Create new was runtime with the new collator with `./scripts/dump_wasm_state_and_spec.sh <desired_chain>`
#   3.  Migrate storage from production chain to local setup with https://github.com/ajuna-network/Ajuna.StorageTools/blob/main/Ajuna.StorageTools/Program.cs
#   4.  Call: `sudo.call(parachainSystem.(authorizeUgrade(...))`
#   5.  Call: `parachainSystem.enactAuthorizedUpgrade()`
#   6.  Wait until the code is applied.
